CHAPTER 8: BUILDING AND SECURING WEB SERVICES USING MINIMAL APIS

• Building web services using ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs
• Relaxing the same origin security policy using CORS
• Preventing denial of service attacks using rate limiting
• Improving startup time and resources using native AOT
• Understanding identity services

<ImplicitUsings> does heavy lifting for removing boilerplate code

Minimal apis do not dynamically generate code like controllers allowing for native AOT for producing smaller, faster services
